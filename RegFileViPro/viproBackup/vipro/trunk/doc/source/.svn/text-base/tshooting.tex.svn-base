\section{Trouble-shooting tips}
If things are not working, one or more of the following things may be the reason.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Configuration error - One or both of user.m and bitcellSizes.m could be absent, missing some mandatory parameters, or have wrong parameters.

\item Flag error - Make sure that the right flags are provided. For example, the --char needs to be use at least once for each technology to produce the TASE characterization data. 

\item TASE failure - The characterization step can fail for a number of reasons - 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}
\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}
\item Environment setup
\item Model file path
\item Simulation setup
\item Matlab
\item LaTeX
\end{itemize}
For more details on these and ways to debug and fix TASE problems, refer to the TASE user guide.

\end{enumerate}
