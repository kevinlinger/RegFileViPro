This directory has the following files:

bitcellSizes.m (generated) -
--------------
The final output of the bitcell generator is here. It has the 3x2=6 device dimensions and the bitcell layout dimensions.

calcParams.m (generated) -
------------ 
The data extracted from the output of the characterizer run for variables used in the SRAM model calculations is written to this file. E.g. - gate and junction capacitances, Ions, Ioffs etc.

cellGen.ini - 
-----------
The constraints and configuration file for the cellgenerator. User provides bitcell level constraints here.

user.m - 
------
User provides global inputs like technology, memory capacity etc. here.

constructor.m (generated) -
-------------
The concatention of the .m files which is used to instantiate the SRAM object. This file will be generated after the bitcell generator and characterizer are run.

Components -
----------
User lists the template names for specific sub-components to plug into the memory hierarchy instead of using the default model. Templates can be in spectre or ocean format.
