\begin{abstract}
This report has been auto generated by a tool, originally designed at the University of Virginia, to automate the process of characterizing new process models. All data herein was automatically produced via a suite of generic Spectre tests in an effort to more efficiently define a new process development kit (PDK). Any questions relating to the operation or results of this tool should be addressed to the authors aforementioned in this document.
