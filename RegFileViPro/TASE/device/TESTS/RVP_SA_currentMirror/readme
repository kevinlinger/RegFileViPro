Brief description of the test - Power, energy and delay for basic current SA

Detailed description
Transient sim, 
1. Calculate delay for SA to resolve, starting from SAEN going high
2. Avg power of SA
3. Avg power * resolution time = SA Energy
Need to refine the test more. Only power is being calculated right now. 

list of any additional parameters needed (this is especially helpful as the tests grow more complicated)
deltavbl - the bitline differential
