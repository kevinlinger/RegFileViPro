2. N-curve for read stability and write stability
N-curve is an alternative to static noise margins as a metric for read and write stability for the bitcell.  This metric provides info in terms of current.  More details in Grosser [2006].

Unfortunately this oceanscript test currently takes about 7.5 minutes to run
because there are two sweeps in nested loops (VIN and VDD).  It should be
faster - maybe with one long transient simulation?
