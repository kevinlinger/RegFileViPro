R.Mann 
Qcrit simulation to find the critical charge for a given pulse shape (simulating a high energy alpha particle strike) on the n+ diffusion of the internal latch high node. This program performs a binary search. The default is to find the peak current spike to within 1um.  This is typically the 3rd decimal for the Qcrit value.

drain interseting particle strike is simulated (see netlist to change the particle strike simulation)
