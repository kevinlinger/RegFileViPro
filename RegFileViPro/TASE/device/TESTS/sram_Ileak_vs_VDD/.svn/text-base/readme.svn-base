# SRAM 6T Cell Leakage Current (nominal case) vs. VDD 
This test uses DC analysis to measure the leakage current of an SRAM 6T bitcell during hold. 
Sub-threshold leakge, gate leakage, GIDL/junction current, and total leakage current are plotted. 

# Note: no body biasing is used in the current setting
