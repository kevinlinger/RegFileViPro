Old specification:
------------------
Inverter pmos width and nand nmos width are swept for different number of cells on the WL. Peak and average power, and delay are measured.

The data is recorded in triples (average pwr, peak pwr, delay) with the values for a given pmos inv width per line for each value of number of columns (WL cap)

Optimization knobs:
device sizes in nand and inv of WL driver
wp_inv, wn_nand

New specification:
------------------
Final inverter pmos width is alone swept. The inverter nmos is half the width of the pmos and the preceeding nand follows a fo4 rule. 

The width may be constrained not at the minimum but at a larger value depending on ease and symmetry of layout. For example, the WL Drivers are easily pitchmatched and symmetric about the x-axis if the min. width for nand FETs is constrained to 0.2u instead of the min. width of 0.12u, and that for inverters to 0.4 (with 2 fingers) instead of 0.12u. This is what was done for the fsl 65 tapeout.
