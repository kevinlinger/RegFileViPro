Original spec: 7. Cell ratio vs. voltage of '0' node @ read access
This is a plot of the bump or ripple in the node storing 0 at the time of read access versus the W/L ratio of the inverter and access n-mos transistors. This ripple voltage can be a design constraint and for a given value of the ripple, the cell sizing can be derived.

Run with Sweep analysis with default settings for step size resulting in 50 steps. Current form of the plotGen.m file is inelegant with a brute force approach used for loading the data and finding the peak ripple value with multiple statements used instead of a loop. Need to figure out if there is a more elegant way to plot the graph.

Test runs fine, but hangs at the dat2img stage. It hangs when executing the matlab shell command. When I ran this command myself, it gave me a prompt saying the system doesn't support the matlab version, asking me if I wanted to continue. This is probably why it hung. When I answer yes, I get an error saying 
"ld.so.1: MATLAB: fatal: libm.so.2: open failed: No such file or directory"
and Matlab crashes.
