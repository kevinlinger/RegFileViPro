Original spec: Write Margin (BL criterion) distribution
Write margin 0 is measured by sweeping down the voltage of bitline that connects with node '1' until the internal nodes flip.

Currently only the write 1 (cell holding '0' before write) scenario is simulated. Later this test should also include write 0 scenario. And the final write SNM is the smaller of the values from these 2 scenarios.

This test now supports both write '1' and '0' scenario.

Update input.tpl and plotGen.m:
  Add a monteCarlo expression "WM_QmQB" to save the voltage difference 
between QB and Q when VBL=VDD. This is needed since Q and QB might not 
cross over during BL sweeping but start from the value opposite to the 
initial node setting and maintain that value all the time.  
  It occurs when the cell's write ability is so strong that Q 
and QB flip at the instant of rising WL before sweeping BL down, which 
is a write success but also a destructive read failure. In this case, 
write margin should be equal to VDD although the measured data 
"WM_fm_Ird"/"WM_fm_VQ" is zero/nil because of no cross-over point.

Change to work with the relative model path defined in the config file

Use the dedicated power supply for cell array (pvdda) and wordline (pvddwl)
 to evaluate write assist techniques
