Original spec: 11. Ion vs. Ioff
SRAM_Ion_Ioff_vs_VDD is a simulation which gives data on cell currents,
including read current (Ion), with varying supply voltage.

Currently the leakage currents are negative for some reason, even though the
iprobes have all been set up in positive directions: current SHOULD flow from
BL to Q2 since BL is at 1V and Q2 is at 0V, from VDD to VDD_OFFCELL because
current can't possibly flow into the voltage source, and VSS_OFFCELL to VSS
because current can't possibly flow out of ground.

This analysis is run with a transient simulation from VDD=pvdd down to 0V at
1u.  It cannot be accurately run with DC analysis because ic/nodeset isn't
working to set the storage nodes and the only other way to run DC analysis is
to assign voltage sources to the internal nodes, which would be incorrect for
Ion since there is a read bump on the 0 node.

Switched back to DC analysis from transient analysis.  Major improvement -
transient analysis showed _negative_ leakage currents for some reason.  The
results look much better now.
