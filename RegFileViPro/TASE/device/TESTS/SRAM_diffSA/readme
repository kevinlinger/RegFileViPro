Measure access time for 6T with differential SA. Currently, the timing of SAEN, WL pulse width etc. needs to be manually tweaked for each pdk.

1. BL and SA inputs are precharged. The BL is connected to the SA through the colmux during this time.
2. BL floats and WL is turned on. BL is still connected to SA input.
3. When 200mV differential is reached, WL is turned off and SA input is disconnected from the BL. SAEN turns on.
4. Once the SA resolves, SAEN turns off and the read is complete.
5. Access delay is measured between WL rising edge and falling edge of SA

Other columns sharing the same SA are represented by a dummy column. BL parasitic capacitance of 0.1fF/cell is assumed based on 32nm ptm interconnect values and bitcell height in 32nm pdk. The accessed cell is assumed to store a 0 with the unaccessed ones storing a 1. All control signals are outputs of buffers to mimic actual signals.

To determine timing for 200 mV differential:
1. Run sim with large WL pulse width. 
cross(v("BL") 0.8 1 'falling) - gives the time until which WL must be kept open
2. CSEL and SAEN go high at this point

Can double check the timing by:
1. cross(v("SAEN") 0.5 1 'rising) - gives time at which SA is fired.
2. value(v("BL") <result of 1.>) - gives BL at the time SA is fired, should be ~0.8V.

This is the delay we want:
cross(v("SAIN") 0.5 1 'falling) - cross(v("WL") 0.5 1 'rising)
