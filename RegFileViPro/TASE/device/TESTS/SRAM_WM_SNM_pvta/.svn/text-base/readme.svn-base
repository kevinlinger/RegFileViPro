Original spec: Write SNM distribution
Write SNM is the smallest square that can be embedded btw two VTC curves.

Currently only the write 1 (cell holding '0' before write) scenario is simulated. Later this test should also include write 0 scenario. And the final write SNM is the smaller of the values from these 2 scenarios.

support both write 1 and 0 case now.

Use the dedicated power supply for the cell array (pvdda) and for the wordline (pvddwl)
 to evaluate the VDD callape write assist.
