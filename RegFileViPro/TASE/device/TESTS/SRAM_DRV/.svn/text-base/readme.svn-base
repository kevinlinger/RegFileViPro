Original spec: 6. DRV distribution
DRV is the minimum voltage to which the cell VDD can be dropped down to (for power saving) before the cell loses the data. This plot would be useful for low-power designs and techniques.

Setup as a Monte Carlo sweep with dc analysis. nodeset is used for intial condition specification for Q and QB. In the current setup, vbulk for the pmos is fixed at pvbp (1V for 45nm) and not lowered. The cell vdd is at pvdd and is lowered till the Q and QB waveforms cross. The value of pvdd at the crossing point is set to be the DRV of the cell.
