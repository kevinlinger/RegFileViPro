Original spec: 9. Ioff vs. VDD
SRAM_Ioff_Ileak_vs_VDD is a simulation which gives data on cell leakage currents with varying supply voltage.

Seems to work reasonably well as a DC simulation although I'm not entirely
comfortable with setting the storage nodes directly from the rails.  As a
transient, though, it wouldn't be possible to test leakage throughout the whole
range, because the cell would become corrupted.  Also transients can't be done
while varying device parameters while DC analysis can. - mmccartn

Switched back to DC analysis from transient analysis.  Major improvement.
