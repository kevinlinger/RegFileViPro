R.Mann 
Qcrit simulation to find the critical charge for a given pulse shape (simulating a high energy neutron particle strike) on the n+ diffusion of the internal latch high node. This program performs a binary search. The default is to find the peak current spike to within 1um.  

this simulates a non-drain intersecting neutron particle strike (diffusion mechanism for collection)
