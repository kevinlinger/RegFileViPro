ToDO:
NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE GLITCH IN RDWR SEEN IN THE SIM FOR FSL65

Independent of number of rows and cols. No sweeps in this sim currently since this circuit is not being tweaked for the optimization

Same netlist and analysis as the CD. Only difference is that the measurements now pertain to SA


Measurements:
For write:
SA power - mainly due to RDWR/NRDWR charging up towards the end of the cycle
RDWR/NRDWR charge up delay from SAPREC going low

For read:
SA power due to SA resolving and also RDWR/NRDWR charging back up
SA resolution delay, RDWR/NRDWR charge up delay is ignored as it is only going to charge up by deltaVBL

Output format:

dataw.txt:
avg_pwr pk_pwr dly_blch

datar.txt:
