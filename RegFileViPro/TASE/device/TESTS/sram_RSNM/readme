Original spec: 1. Hold & Read SNMh, SNMl, and SNM distribution
Distributions for Hold (WL=0) and Read (WL=1) Static Noise Margins obtained by Monte Carlo simulation with at least 1000 iterations.

Setup by Jiajing. Currently running Monte Carlo. But there is no variation and all the iterations produce the same SNM values.
