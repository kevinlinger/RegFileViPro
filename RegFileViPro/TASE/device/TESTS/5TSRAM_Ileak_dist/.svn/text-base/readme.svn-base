# SRAM 6T Cell Leakage Current Distribution
This test uses DC analysis to measure the total leakage current of an SRAM 6T bitcell during hold. 
Monte Carlo analysis is performed to get its distribution due to local mismatch. 
The histogram is plotted and the distrubtion is fitted as a log-normal.
Currently, the leakage current at VDD=<pvdd> and VDD=0.3V are saved and plotted.
