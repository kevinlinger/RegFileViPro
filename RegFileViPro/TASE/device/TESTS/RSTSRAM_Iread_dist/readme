# RSTSRAM  Cell Read Current Distribution
This test uses DC analysis to measure the read current through the access transistor and the pulldown transistor. 
Monte Carlo analysis is performed to get its distribution due to local mismatch. 
The histogram is plotted and the distrubtion is fitted as a normal.
