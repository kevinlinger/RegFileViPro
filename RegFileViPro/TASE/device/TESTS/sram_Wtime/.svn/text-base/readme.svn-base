node and write time generated in file = twrite_out.txt.

WL pulse with 5ps rise time is used to generate the write time.

need to specify the following in the *.ini file:

pvdd= vdd
lbl = level of low bitline in write
bitline = level of high bitline in write
wlv = level of WL 
pvbn = pwell voltage
pvbp = nwell voltage
pvss = cell VSS level
