SRAM_Tcrit_mc

This template is similar to the SRAM_Tcrit_mc test, except that instead of running monte carlo, the threshold value of each transistor is swept manually.

For write, the Tcrit is the max of the Tcrit when cell holds 0 and holds 1.

Template-specific parameters specified by the user:
cycle time <tp>
WL rise and fall times <pr> <pf>
min and max WL pulse width <minpw> <maxpw>
start and stop monteCarlo iteration numbers <startIter> <stopIter>
accuracy of binary search <tol>
