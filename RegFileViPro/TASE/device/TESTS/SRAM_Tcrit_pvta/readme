SRAM_Tcrit_mc

This template is similar to the SRAM_Tcrit_mc test, except that instead of running monte carlo, the threshold value of each transistor is swept manually from nominal - 0.2V to nomimal + 0.2V.

For write, the Tcrit is the max of the Tcrit when cell holds 0 and holds 1.

Template-specific parameters specified by the user:
cycle time <tp>
WL rise and fall times <pr> <pf>
min and max WL pulse width <minpw> <maxpw>
start and stop monteCarlo iteration numbers <startIter> <stopIter>
accuracy of binary search <tol>
